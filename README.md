this is made because i have seen none that are free. this one sucks, i know, but who wants to pay for things. just fill out the blanks in the config.json and .env file with whats needed, and feel free to tinker around with the code. you do need an api key, but that is just for the ranks, remove the rank param/find a way to do it with skycrypt that doesnt make you go crazy and make a pr for it if you dont wanna use an api key. everything else requires no api key. the customization isnt crazy but its something. to get the bot running, do npm i, and let that finish. then do node deploy-commands.js, wait for that to finish, press control c, and do node bot.js. congrats, you got the bot running. if you have any requests/issues make a github issue/dm me on discord (please star the repo if you like it, i beg, tyty)
